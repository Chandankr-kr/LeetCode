The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
​
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
​
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
​
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
